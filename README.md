## Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous code doesn't block the execution of other code. It allows your app to remain responsive while tasks like fetching data, waiting for user input, or accessing external resources are happening in the background.
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one line of code at a time. Asynchronous code enables it to handle multiple tasks without stalling the main thread.

## Why Promises?
 - Promises provide a structured way to handle the results of asynchronous operations, making code cleaner and more organized than traditional callback-based approaches.
Key benefits:
 -Improved code readability and maintainability
 -Better error handling
 -Easier chaining of asynchronous operations
